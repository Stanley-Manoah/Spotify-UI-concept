This is an ongoing repository of a UI concept of Spotify videos. The App compiles with no issues however, 
it does not have any configuration beyond the MainActivity yet. With over 200 million monthly active users
Spotify is the only worthy competitor to youtube in the video-sharing platform. Spotify can leverage existing 
Spotify app to promote a version of Spotify Videos app (for example: see Instagram and IGTV).
